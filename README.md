📈 **With over two decades of experience** in the tech industry, I am a seasoned Full Stack Developer, Web App Architect, and DevOps Specialist based in the Greater Paris Metropolitan Region.

👨‍💻 **My expertise spans Python** (Django), JavaScript (Node.js), PostgreSQL, and Azure Cloud platforms, alongside strengths in Natural Language Processing (NLP), API development, and ETL processes. I have a solid background in version control systems like Git (GitHub) and specialize in designing, developing, and deploying scalable web applications and robust cloud infrastructure. Collaborating with cross-functional teams on user-centric approach, I deliver innovative solutions tailored to strategic and operational objectives with a focus on excellence, performance, and client satisfaction.

⏳ Prior to my current role, **I worked as a Webmaster**, specialized in Apache, MySQL, PHP, and various CMS platforms like Drupal, Joomla!, and WordPress. My skills include front-end development using JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, and CSS, as well as domain and DNS management. I also have extensive experience in digital marketing, including SEO and social media strategies.

🎓 I hold a **Master of Science in Management from HEC Paris School of Management**, a Major in Management and New Technologies from Télécom ParisTech, and additional degrees in Political Science and History from University Paris Nanterre. This interdisciplinary education blends digital engineering, business management, and humanities, enriching my technical and collaborative approach.

🌍 My professional journey includes significant **international experiences**. I worked as a consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area (2002-2003), immersing myself in the exciting academic life of the Berkeley campus while gaining insights into North American business dynamics. As a freelance web developer in Istanbul (2011-2013), I experienced the unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures. Recently, my compass has shifted to Northern Europe, where I've joined a Danish team in a hybrid collaboration on cutting-edge projects, while fostering strong cross-cultural relationships. These periods abroad have deepened my adaptability and global perspective, enhancing my ability to thrive in multicultural environments.

🎯 Currently, as **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**, I lead a skilled team of data scientists, web developers, and software engineers to create cutting-edge solutions and digital tools that support researchers, advisors, and research managers in securing funding and fostering academic collaboration.

🚴 When I'm not busy crafting digital solutions, you can find me lacing up my hiking boots to explore scenic trails or **enjoying the great outdoors** through sightseeing adventures. I also love to grab my bike and spend all day long exploring the vibrant streets of European capitals. To unwind, I indulge in my passion for live acoustic music concerts, with a particular fondness for jazz and classical music.

💎 I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and **continuously expanding my skill set** to provide top-tier solutions for my clients. Let's build something extraordinary together!
